Description of Project:

- In this project, I created a form for Business Analytics & Information Systems students to fill out that provides information on where they are from and what they think of the BAIS major. I also ensured that the form follows best practices and includes user accessibility features.

How does my Web Form conform to best practices:

- My web form conforms to best practices in many ways. First, the form begins by stating the estimated time required to complete the survey and explaining its purpose. This provides users with clear expectations regarding the survey's content and duration. Upon opening the form, I use the autofocus attribute to automatically place the cursor in the "Home Country" field, allowing for a seamless user experience by eliminating an extra step. Additionally, I structured the questions across two pages to prevent overwhelming the user. My question fields are spaced out to enhance readability.

- The survey starts with the easiest questions and gradually progresses to more specific ones. This approach increases user engagement, as the more fields they complete, the more invested they feel in finishing the survey. I also include progress indicators that inform users how much longer the survey will take. The multi-page format helps maintain focus while optimizing data collection. Lastly, all labels are clear and concise. Required fields include warnings to ensure I collect the necessary data before users submit the form. The form will not move on until all data is collected.

How does my Web Form provide user accesibility:

- My form is accessible in several ways. First, it is robust, meaning it is compatible with both computers and mobile devices. Second, it is easy to understand. I ensured that all questions are straightforward. For example, in the question "What is your hometown?", I clarified that I am asking for the user's hometown before college to prevent confusion. Additionally, I included an image on the last page with an alternative text description. This ensures that blind users who rely on screen readers can understand the image content. Lastly, I used basic colors and a large font size to accommodate users with visual impairments.
